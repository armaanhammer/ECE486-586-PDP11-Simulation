The TA's example files are:
- addc.ascii
- addc.mac
- PDP11.txt
- PDP-11 part2.txt

As far as I understand it, the files work like so:

Feeding addc.mac into Faust's binary should produce addc.ascii

Feeding addc.ascii into our PDP-11 simulator should produce results that somehow relate to the two PDP11 text files.
