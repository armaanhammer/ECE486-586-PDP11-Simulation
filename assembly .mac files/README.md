The TA's example files are:
- addc.ascii
- addc.mac
- PDP11.txt
- PDP-11 part2.txt

As far as I understand it, the files work like so:

Feeding _addc.mac_ into Faust's binary should produce _addc.ascii_

Feeding _addc.ascii_ into our PDP-11 simulator should produce results that somehow relate to the two _PDP11_ text files.
